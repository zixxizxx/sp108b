MIT 6.828(Operating System Engineering) Lab Report 
---
  The answers for the labs of this course. 

Introduction
---
  MIT 6.828 is a famous course of OS, which is composed of several excellent labs. By completing those labs, we can create a tiny OS called JOS eventually. I think that it is a novel and effictive way to deepen our understanding of mechanism of OS.

Projects
---
  This project includes several tags. <br>
  * The `master` branch is the combination of the answers of all completed labs.
  * The `lab1` tag is the answer for lab 1, the `lab2` is the answer for lab 2, and so on.
  
Contents
---
  The structure of each branch consists of 3 folders: <br>
  * lab -- The source files of OS kernel (including answers)
  * hw -- The answer for the homeworks of this course.
