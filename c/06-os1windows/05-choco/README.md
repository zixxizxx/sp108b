Chocolatey v0.10.11
Chocolatey detected you are not running from an elevated command shell
 (cmd/powershell).

 You may experience errors - many functions/packages
 require admin rights. Only advanced users should run choco w/out an
 elevated shell. When you open the command shell, you should ensure 
 that you do so with "Run as Administrator" selected. If you are    
 attempting to use Chocolatey in a non-administrator setting, you   
 must select a different location other than the default install    
 location. See 
 https://chocolatey.org/install#non-administrative-install for details.
